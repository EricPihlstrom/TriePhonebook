# TriePhonebook

This was my final project for Data Structures. We were to create something using a data structure that we did not directly learn about in the class. I chose to 
use a Trie to make a phonebook. The user has options to choose from using the user interface such as adding an entry, deleting an entry, displaying all of the 
current entries etc. This program is designed to be run in the terminal. Once running, follow the commands through the interface.
